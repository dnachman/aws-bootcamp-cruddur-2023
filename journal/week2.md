## Amazon XRay
- Added instrumentation to app.py
- Set up xray group:
```
aws xray create-group --group-name "Cruddur" --filter-expression "service(\"backend-flask\")"
```
- Set up sampling rules:
```
aws xray create-sampling-rule --cli-input-json file://aws/json/xray.json
```
- Added the daemon to docker-compose.  
- Had to make sure app was initialized before xray (before I got to that part in the video ;) )
- Ran and checked traces:
